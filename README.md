# Advent of Code 2023 - Haskell

This repository contains my solutions to the [2023 edition of Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) problems (or only some of them, we'll see...).

I'll use these challenges to have fun while learning Haskell. I am also reading through [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) at the same time, which I'm really enjoying so far.
